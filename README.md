# FilteringWithTheSky
This project utilizes Arduino and Java to manipulate actuators and sensors in order to detect certain weather conditions. Weather conditions such as rain will produce a response which activates the filtration system. This will then collect and filter the rain water.

This project comprises of 4 different files which work together in order for all actuators and sensors dedicated to certain pins to work together.
